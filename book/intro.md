# Introduction

In this project we will be exploring the breadown of the rotating wave approximation (RWA) of the Jaynes cummings(JC) hamiltionian. The JC hamiltonian discribes the coupling between a two level system and a quantized harmonic oscillator. For weak coupling it is valid to use the RWA to the remove fast counter rotating terms from the hamiltotian because they are almost non contributing terms. Our goal for this project is to look at when this approximation fails and how it compares to the system with no RWA approximation.

**Research Questions**
- How do does the hamiltonian differ with and without RWA?
- What does the RWA imply physically?
- In what conditions is the RWA approximation good and in which, not accurate?
- How can we calibrate our system to avoid or cause breakdown of RWA?

## We will conduct the following experiments:
As the hamiltonian is the observable for energy, we will explore how the energy eigenstates differ for the hamiltonian with and without RWA. We will vary the detuning and coupling paramters and explore when the energy eigenstates breakdown.

- The derivation of JC Hamiltonian and discuss what the RWA is.
- The difference in eigenenergies for increasing decoupling and detuning. 
- Changes in the wigner function of the ground state and the corresponding \(x\) and \(p\) distrubutions.
- How the RWA deviates under the Lindblad master equation.
