    "In this project we have looked at the breakdown of the rotating wave approximation of the Jaynes cummimgs hamiltonian. Our main goal was to find out when this approximation fails by looking at many aspects of our system and seeing how the RWA causes deviation from the full JC hamiltonian. \n",
    "\n",
    "We analysed how the eigeneenergies of the eigenstates changed for our system when there was a increase in coupling and found that RWA induces a significant error in the eigenenergies"
